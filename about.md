My name is David. I am sneaky and clever like a fox. I've been making websites since my early teens, and really haven't developed any skills over the past 15 years, you do the math. The bulk of my knowledge is in PHP/MySQL and jQuery/JavaScript, but I've dabbled in various programming languages. I hope you find what you're looking for... and if you don't, well you probably don't know how to use Google very well.
