I work on web application development using the LAMP stack, because it's cheaper. I use OS X, it's just my preference, not cheaper. [Atom](https://atom.io) is my current text editor, [Sequel Pro](http://www.sequelpro.com) I use for database management, and the OS X Terminal app with [TotalTerminal](http://totalterminal.binaryage.com) for the ~ hotkey. I'm not really fucking with iTerm 2 or Sublime Text 2 (almost 3)... I have my reasons. Another good little app is [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com), helps me organize my desktop windows etc. Been using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) for a while, package manager for OS X, helps if you want to install a local copy of MySQL or PHP. A good tool to use with that is [Cakebrew](https://www.cakebrew.com), provides a little UI.

Recently, I've been working with [Laravel](https://laravel.com), and I must say [Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/master/homestead) is pretty cool for setting up a quick VM with everything you need to develop a PHP/MySQL application, and particularly if you are using a framework like Laravel. You will need to install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) first, but that doesn't take long. Also good to check out [Lumen](https://lumen.laravel.com), their micro-framework. I've been using [Flight](http://flightphp.com) in the past, which is good for smaller applications.
